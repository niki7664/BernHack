Set atop a ridge at 2073m, just off the road to Trisuli Bazaar, Kakani is the quieter, slower cousin of Dhulikhel and Nagarkot. From a series of high points along the ridge, there are magnificent views of the Himalayan skyline stretching all the way from Annapurna to Everest, via Manaslu, Ganesh Himal, Gauri Shankar, Dorje Lekpa and Shishapangma.Kakani is a major gateway for Picnic, hiking and mountain biking routes in neighbouring Shivapuri National Park.",

            title : "Nagarkot",
            description : "Nagarkot has a reputation as the top spot for enjoying Himalayan views from the comfort of your hotel balcony. Just 32km from Kathmandu, the village is packed with hotels lining a ridge, affording one of the broadest possible views of the Himalaya, with eight ranges visible (Annapurna, Manaslu, Ganesh Himal, Langtang, Jugal, Rolwaling, Everest and Numbur). However, timing is everything, as the mountains are notorious for disappearing behind cloudy skies. The best viewing seasons are October to December and March to April, when clear skies are likely. Other than views, the town offers very little, so if you want to get out of your hotel you'll need to head to another resort, or into the outdoors. Note that if you have just arrived at Tribhuvan Airport, it's possible to come directly to Nagarkot and chill out in nature if you wish to avoid the city. Bring warm clothing after mid-October.",
